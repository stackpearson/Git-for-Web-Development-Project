Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	it's position will not change relative to the rest of the content
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
	set display to inline-block;
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Block: <div> <section> <p>
        Inline: <span> <a>
        Inline-block: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
	The box model helps visualize how content is designed and laid out on the page. Your content is surounded by 3 layers. From inside out: Content, padding, border & margin. Padding clears space between the content & Border. The border is sandwhiched between the padding and margin, this can be styled outside of just the size. The final layer is margin which adds clear space between the border & surrounding content.

 
The only problem with this is that your declared width & height applies specifically to your element. Padding, border & margin are in addition to this. That can make scaling for responsiveness a bit tricky. A solution to this is to change yoru box sizing to Border-box. This will include your padding & border in the set heighth/width that you specify in your CSS.
	* {
           box-sizing:border-box;
       }
